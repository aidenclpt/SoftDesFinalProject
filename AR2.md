AR 2
Ricky Rose, Grace Montagnino, Aiden Carley-Clopton

Background and context 

Our goal is to use Satellite Images of cities to extract street maps. There will be a UI that allows users to adjust thresholds of details, etc. In addition we have considered the addition of a collection of statistics that arise from the mapping (such as how “regular” the grid is, how long the typical block is, longest contiguous street, etc). Attached to this link (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r2NBaygQt3MG-0KucoSuDkRPyRz04g6AXdGtaVoWGT0/edit?usp=sharing) is the PowerPoint presentation we will use, where we give background on each major component of our project.

Key questions 

Now that we have a sense of direction, we are struggling with which path to take to get us there. Some technical/ architectural questions we have are outlined in the PowerPoint linked above. The questions are organized by which subset they are relevant to (UI, Image Processing, Feature Detection), and then are followed by a few overarching questions to make sure we get feedback on each piece, but also the project concept as a whole.

Agenda

We will start the AR by going through our goals, what we have done so far, and an explanation of each major system. Next we will ask for feedback specific to each subsystem. Finally we will ask for overarching feedback, before taking final comments.

Feedback 

We believe we will have enough time to get in- person feedback as this AR is longer and with a smaller group of people. However, we have included a short survey for any lingering comments (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecYHpADaLhBZVPK_Jrh_o6lmdERM00MqzOi3xppguAi1IiDQ/viewform?c=0&w=1)
