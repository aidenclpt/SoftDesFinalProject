### GIS
+ Shows before and after images of satellite image processed and not processed
+ Shows with color balance and without image
+ Snippets of code to show what is being done to image
+ Shows how each pixel is mapped to a latitude/longitude

The GIS portion of our code starts by parsing metadata. A world file (.wld) looks like this

    4.0200000000 
    0.0000000000 
    0.0000000000 
    -4.0200000000 
    496748.3682234660 
    4427796.8562399521
   
These values represent the x resulution, rotation, y resolution and UTM northing and easting of the top left corner.
