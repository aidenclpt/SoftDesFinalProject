## Our Project Goal

Our project converts image pixels to latitude and longitude in the real world
You can use this to find real lengths from satellite images
You can find nearby attractions by clicking on a satellite image location
You can map out a trail you are taking or a trip, and it will deliver the distance of that trip and some statistics about it
*Insert Video of us using this to find trip distances (gif)

## Our Story
We started with pattern detection done by the computer. We soon leanred that people are much better at recognizing patterns than computers, but computers can give statistics that people cannot. Thus we pivoted to allow users to write in their patterns, and have the computer return the statistics.
