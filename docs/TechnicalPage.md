### Technical Page
  Implementation:
+ We will have a flow chart separated into three main blocks- image processing, google maps API, GUI
+ We will then treat each module as its own heading and within them explain their flow process
+ Generally the process is Parse GIS -> maps API -> GUI
 Maps API-> takes a given latitude and longitude -> gives latitude and longitude to google places then returns location details and address -> can now return name of neighborhood, rating of the area, etc. ->searches address within given radius for restaurants nearby -> searches google images by restaurant name and returns images
